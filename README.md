# Hi, I'm Alvaro Lazarus üëã

<p align="center">
  A developer from Costa Rica, building tools to unlock Latin America's potential.

### My Mission

I believe Latin America is home to some of the world's brightest and most creative minds. But I also know that talent is universal, while opportunity is not. My life's work is dedicated to closing that gap.

I'm focused on using technology‚Äîspecifically Artificial Intelligence‚Äîto build systems that make high-quality, personalized education accessible to everyone. My goal is to create a future where a person's ambition is the only limit to their destiny.

To stay accountable and build with the community, I am documenting my entire journey in public.

### üöÄ What I'm Building Now: Project "MentorIA"

**Project "MentorIA"** is the first step in this mission. It's an AI-powered study companion designed to act as a personal, 24/7 tutor for students.

* **The Problem It Solves:** Traditional education struggles to adapt to individual learning styles. My goal is to provide a tool that feels like a dedicated partner in learning‚Äîone that is patient, engaging, and always available.
* **The Current Stage:** I am currently in the deep-work phase, building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and laying the foundational code.

* **Core Languages:** `Python`, `TypeScript`
* **AI / Machine Learning:** `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, `Scikit-learn`, `LangChain`

### üå± Let's Connect & Build Together

This mission is bigger than just one person. I'm always open to connecting with fellow builders, educators, and anyone passionate about the future of Latin America.

* **Connect professionally on LinkedIn ‚Üí** For more formal discussions and networking.
* **Explore my projects ‚Üí** Dive into the code and see how the vision is being built.
